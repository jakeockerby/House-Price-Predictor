# House-Price-Predictor
Model that predicts house prices.

# Project Overview
-Used the XGBoost python library to build models
-Split the data into two with train_test_split built-in function
-Calculated mean absolute error for the model
-Created a new, more accurate model with the XGBoost parameters n_estimators and learning_rate
-The new model can predict house prices with a mean error of approx. $16800
